        Expansion is relevant for values which are saved as integer

        iteration on the filter stack. The search is case sensitive.

        The filter stack is a list of tuples which describe the filter
        expression. Each tuple consists of three values:

        1. The search expression
        2. Optionally the name of the column on which the search will be
           applied.
        3. Boolean flag to indicate that the given search expression
           should be handled as a regular expression.

        The search support three modes. On default the search will look
        for the presence of the given search string within the values of
        the item. It will also match on parts of the string. So
        searching for 'Foo' will also match 'Foobar'. Another mode is
        using the search expression as a regular expression. The last
        mode makes use of special operators. The search supports the
        following operators: "<", "<=", "!=", ">" ">=" and "~" The
        operator can be provided with the search string.  It mus be the
        first word of the search expression. If a operator is present it
        will be used.

        The "~" operator will trigger a fuzzy search using the Double
        Metaphone algorithm for determining equal phonetics. If the
        phonetics do not match the Levenshtein distance will be
        calculated. 

        The search will iterate over all items in the list. For each
        item the function will try to match the value of either all, or
        from the configured search field with the regular expression or
        configured operator. If the value matches, then the item is kept
