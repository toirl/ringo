1.15.0
======
- Bugfix for "app.mode" config option. App mode was broken for all modes
  execept "testing" because the test db request was accessed in all cases even
  if its not present
- Changed API of importer. Removed "use_uuid" attribute. You must now provide
  the key which is used to load items from the database using the "load_key"
  attribute which defaults to "uuid".
- Added "renderer" config option to the overview configuration. This lets you
  set a custom renderer for a column.
- Added "hidden" and "searchable" configuration options to the tableconfig.
  This allows to define which field are searchable. Can be combined to make
  hiddenfields searchable.

1.14.0
======
- Rewrite of the documentation.
- Fixed issue21 (https://github.com/ringo-framework/ringo/issues/21). Enabled
  sorting config in Listingfieldrenderer.
- Expand values from checkboxes too.
- Added XLSX Export.
- Introduced special suffix `__e_x_p_a_n_d` for attributes which can be used to
  access the expanded value of the attribute as alternative to the call of
  get_value. This is needed because it is not always possible to call the
  get_value method. Example: getattr(obj, 'foo__e_x_p_a_n_d') will return the
  expanded value of the `foo` attribute.
- Removed ODF-Converter from Ringo core. It is now part of the
  ringo_printtemplate extensions as this is the only place where it is
  actually used.
- #5 Show info dialog on circualr dependency error on deletion
- #11 Check uniqueness of name when on creating and update of roles.
- #12 With fix for #5 the admin user can not delete himself anymore, because
  of handling of circular dependency.
- #14 Make name field of modules readonly. Field is internal and not meant to
  be editable.
- #19 Fixed removing permissions (in general fixed removing items from
  nm-relations.) 
- Added "button" layout for the Statefieldrenderer.
- Handle "Save and proceed" button (New feature in formbar).
- Added StaticListRenderer. Can be used to render simple static overviews of
  items.
- On user registration the password strength is now checked. Password must be
  at least 12 chars long und need to have 2 non chars.
- Add option to define rolespecific descriptions of the state.
- Add option to configure a callback after a user has authenticated with the
  application. This callback can be used to cancel the authentification or to
  further actions after the user logs in.
- Added sorting icons for datatables.
-

1.13.3
======
Bugfix release. Fixes serious problem handling addrelations based on the
session variable. This error may cause wrong relations between items.

1.13
====
- Fixes in scaffold. Improve default MANIFEST and include more files. Make
  README a RST-File
- Internal UUID field is now 36 chars long. UUID is now stored as defined in
  RFC4122. Please note that existing UUIDs are not converted. You can convert
  exitsing UUIDs by using the "ringo-admin db resetuuid" command.
- Fixed #19 (https://github.com/ringo-framework/ringo/issues/19)
- Let users delete their own account. You can define the behavior to items
  defined by the user by setting the _owner_cascades class variable with in
  the models to e.g configure to delete all items which are owned by the item
  to. On default users can only delete their account if the do now own any
  items anymore. 
- Implemented "roles" config variable for columns in table configs. If
  defined columns are only visible to users who have one of the
  configured roles.
- Added "target" attribute to the Linkfieldrenderer.

1.12
====
- Be more tolerant in imports. Only log in case the import includes fields
  which are not part of the model.
- Added config varibables to define default roles and groups on user
  registration.
- Added config variable "layout.show_contextmenu" to configure the visibility
  of the context menu.
- Improve result page after a user register a new user account.
- Improve result page after a user request a passwort reset.

1.11.2
======
- Small performance improvement. Added option to enable caching of the
  form configuration. This will prevent the application to reload the
  configuration on every request which is expensive. This is usefull for
  production envirionments as the form will not change here. However it is not
  recomended in development mode.
  Please refer to the documentation to see how to enable form caching.
- Fixed reraising exception withing general_exception view. Further only use
  this view in testing mode.
- Render title tooltips in table header of overviews
- Make registration and activation of users over the webinterface work again. This means
  new user can register themself using the webinterface if registration is
  enabled.
- Added scaffolds to the MANIFEST.in file. Has been missing.
- Fixed bug which causes exceptions in testcases because new created and
  loaded items in different Sqlachemy sessions. Use current db session from
  request when invoking the load method of a factory to enforce all items are
  attached to the same session.
- Added external requirements.txt file for scaffolds.
- Support DATABASE_URL envirionment variable. If set than this variable will
  be used to connect to the database. Eg: postgres://@/ringo

1.11.1
======
Bugfixrelease

- Reraise origin exception (including stacktrace) in case of errors in global
  error view to allow better debugging of errors. The origin stackstrace was
  hidden since the last version which introduces a global error view. This
  error view hides the origin traceback.

1.11.0
======
- Tests are now based on pytest. Removed tests based on the package "behave".
  Ringo now requires a package pytest-ringo which provides some helper classes
  to make testing more easy. Further the tests now support rollbacks.
- Changed behaviour how Ringo extensions are registered on application
  startup. Ringo now only shows a short warning on application start if a new
  added or removed extension is detected. It does not ask the user if ringo
  should register the extension automatically anymore which make the startup
  more robust on servers with no active terminal (e.g starting as WSGI).
  Adding or removing extensions in normale usage should be added or removed by
  migration scripts.
- Added "ringo-admin app add-extension|remove-extension" command to add
  or remove the initial modul and action entries during development.
- Improved documentation on how to add extensions in the application.


1.10.5
======
- Show info dialog at the top to the form in case the validation fails.
  This info has been added because users reported data loss because of
  formbar/ringo default behaviour of not saving anything in case of
  errors. Users seems to expect that the valid part of the data has been
  saved. This info should make the user aware of the fact that nothing
  has been saved in case of errors

1.10.4
======
Bugfixrelease

- Only log validation errors in DEBUG loglevel.
- Fixed changed field names in user registration.
- Fixed test cases

1.10.3
======
Bugfixrelease

- Fixed bug (Introduced with 1.10.2) when encoding values in GET params. Ringo
  uses a special notation for encoding values in the URL as GET param in the
  `values` key. This method failed for values containing non ASCII values.

1.10.2
======
Maintenance and Bugfixrelease

- Cleanup after move to Github:
	- Removed .coveragerc. Not using coverage at the moment.
	- Removed .hgflow. Not using the hg anymore
	- Removed .hgignore. Not using the hg anymore
	- Removed .tx. Currently not using Transifex for translations.
- Changed links in Documentation and README to refer to Github now.
- Do not log that we are calling get_current_request. This is a long standing
  design flaw in Ringo but it does not cause any known problems yet and it is
  unlikly to change in the near future. So i replaced the logging with a
  "fixme" comment.
- Log "errors" while resolving dot separated values in lists only in the debug
  log (was error) in _resolve_attribute. As this might be a sign of an
  missconfiguration it is actually handled in the function so we do not log an
  error message but give a hint in in the logging in development. 
- Log failing CSRF token checks as warning.
- Using encode_values to encode the value for the values attribut in GET
  params now returns a urlencoded value. This results in the values will be
  double encoded. Added decode_values helper method which can decode
  urlencoded values back into a python dictionary. WARNING: If you are using
  the values GET param in your application, than you may want to adapt your
  code. 
- Added/Improved authentification check in setstanding and changepassword
  method by adding missing checks and more comments.
- Make fields for the profile while user creation a logical field which is not
  stored in the datamodel. This prevents warning messages.
- Make field 'retype_password' a logical field which is not stored in the
  datamodel. This prevents warning messages

1.10.1
======
Bugfixrelease

- Updated translations.
- Fixed bug that set the display variable wrong (uses str_repr instead) when
  registering a extension.
- Added compatibility mode regading Ringos behaviour on adding "s" to the
  modul names when registering modules. The name of the modul of the extension
  is defined in the extension itself and should be taken as it is on default.
  However. Ringo tries also load the modul by adding an "s" to be compatible
  with older versions.
- Changed warning message on application startup when Ringo notices that there
  is a extenstion which needs to be registered. Fixed showing name of the
  extension.
- Fix scaffold for extensions. Handle case that the user cancel the automatic
  registering of the modul.
- Refactored the importer code in ringo/scripts/db.py and make the code better
  reusable for other commands.

 
1.10.0
======
* The behavior of overviews using the Datatable JS library can now be
  configured with the JSON table configurations too. Formerly only the columns
  can be configured.  Now other aspects like, filtering, sorting, paginating
  etc. You can also define your own custom filters.

  The configuration will be generated on the fly based on the JSON config when
  rendering the overview. This generated configuration will replace the static
  predefined datatable configurations found in the init.js.

* Added datatable-moment.js  plugin to allow sorting datatable tables based on
  datefields.

1.9.1
=====
Bugfixrelease

- Fix internal list renderer and handle case if current user has no
  permissions at all. Then no links will be rendered.
- Fix has_role method. Handle case if current user is None.

1.9
===
- Log login attemps. Each successfull or failed login will now be saved in a
  table called "user_logins".
- Show info on last successful and last failed login on the index page of the
  application. Additionally show a warning if there have been more than 5
  failed logins since the last successful login.
  This feature need to be enabled in the ini file. See documentation for more
  details.

1.8
===
- Implemented session timer widget. The widget shows the remaining time in the
  session before the autologout will be triggered.
  The widget needs to be enabled in the .ini file. See documentation for more
  details.
- Dogpile caching for SQL need to be enabled explicit now.
- Enhanced breadcrum feature. Allow to define additional actions which should
  be displayed in the breadcrumbs beside the default actions.
- Changed Mailer. The Subject of the Mails do not include a prepended name of the
  application anymore.

1.7
===
- Ringo no longer does automatic extension registering on server
  startup. Registering a new extension often will write changes to the
  database. This is dangerous as this will potentially lead into
  failing later migrations. So Ringo will now ask the user what to do on
  server start. Default is to abort the registration.
- Added JQuery UI library. This library is currently not used by ringo itself
  but it provides basic functionality to other applications.
- Added breadcrumbs feature to Ringo. To be able to use the breadcrumbs you
  need to define a sitetree (See lib/sitetree.py for more details.) The
  default sitetree of ringo is empty which means no breadcrumbs are shown.
- Added "--format" flag for the "ringo-admin db loaddata" command to define
  the format of the inputfile. It is now possible to use the CSV importer
  also.

1.6
===
- Add functionallity for users so set their standin. Basically this is adding
  and removing other users to the default group of the user. To use this
  feature the user needs at least read access to the users he wants to set as
  standin.
- Changes favicon format to "ico" to be more compatible with versions of IE.
  Improved overwriting of the favicon. The code for favicons are now placed in
  favicons.mako which can be overwritten by other applications.
- Fixed handling of bundled delete requests. Two things has been changed: 
    1. Call the callback before actually deleting it to allow some cleanup. 
    2. Put the flush of the db operations at the end of the method to
       avoid "Closed connection" errors which happens for bundled delete
       request after the session has been flushed for the first item.


1.5
===
- Added new configuration variable 'app.mode' to be able to run the
  application in a different mode. If set the application will give some
  visual indication the the application is in a different mode.
- Changed default rendering of overview pages. Instead of using a
  complex overview with advanced search filters e.g Ringo now uses a
  simplified overview on default. The behaviour can be changed by either
  setting a global `layout.advanced_oveview` configuration varible in
  the ini file or per table configuration in the json config of the
  table. In the simplified overview features like pagination are currently disabled
  regardless what is configured in the table configuration. This may change in
  future versions.
- Changed click behaviour in overview tables. Rows are now clickable. With the
  change to the simplified overview code the way to select items from the
  overview changed also. Links has been removed completely now. Instead the
  whole row is clickable.

1.4
===
- Dropped SQLite support because of missing support of data migrations using
  alembic. Postgresql is the new default for the DMBS system.
  Added psycopg2 as requirement. Actually Sqlite support was broken since
  version 1.2.
- Removed fixtures for initial data. Data is now added to the migration
  scripts.
- Added new "--format" flag for the "db savadata" command to determine the
  export format. Default is JSON.

1.3
===
- Added new configuration varibale (auth.timeout_warning) to configure how
  many secods before the autologout happens a warning will be shown.

1.2.2
=====
- BaseFactory now take an optional argument for a request.
- The callback parameter in the views can now take a list of callbacks too.
  The handle_callback method is able to handle this correct. Please note that
  this mechanism needs some effort of the developer to build this list in the
  view function.
- Add additional callback parameter to the create view of users. This allows
  other views to overwrite the user create view and add custom callbacks.

1.2.1
=====
- Fixed circular dependency error on migration using alembic after adding
  uid and gid fields for users and usergroups which where self referencing.

1.2.0
=====
Beside the major changes which are listed below this version include many
small bugfixes and improvements in the code, usability and performance.

New:
- Add option to provide external validators to the update and create view.
  They will be used for additional validation of the form.
- Implemented a simple Warning Dialog if the user leaves of form without
  saving the changed data first.
- Added simple spinner which pops up if the loading of the page takes longer
  than 400ms.
- Added new "ringo-admin app init" command to initalise a folder containing
  a initial config file.
- Password must be at least 12 chars long and include 2 non-letters.
- Added support for loading configurations in case of multi-derived
  applications. Added new app.base configuration variable.
- Added new helper command to copie the static files of formbar into to
  correct location in ringo.
- Added option to name the authentification cookie. Needed if there are more
  than one ringo application on a server.
- Added a warning dialog which shows if the user leaves a form without saving
  it before.
- Do permission checks on submitted values for relations on POST requests.
  Users are not allowed to set items in relations for which they do not have
  read permissions.
- Log changes of uid and gid.

Changed:
- Enabled Mako default HTML escaping for Template rendering globally in ini
  file and explicit for form rendering, dialog rendering and listing
  rendering. Excluded html escaping for messages and the admin scripts as the
  rendered result is not aimed to be displayed in a browser.
- Seperated requirements for testing, installation etc.
- Static files from formbar are only copied on application start if there are
  not already the formbar files located in ringo. (Need some work). See
  "formbar_static" command.
- Fixed typos in german translation.
- Changed behavior of the warning for a nearing auto logout. Instead of
  showing after 95% of the logout time is up it will now be shown 3 Minutes
  before the actual logout happens.
- The modules for Roles, Users and Usergroups are now inherited from the
  "Owned" mixin class.
- Changed setting the GID for new items. Changed order of determining
  the GID (inverse order). First try to get the default_gid from the
  modul. If not present use the default_gid from the user. Of no
  default_gid is set at all leave the GID of the new item blank.

Removed:
- Removed group role feature. This feature was only rarly used.
- app.url configuration variable which was intended to use in scenarios where
  the application is not hosted under the root of the server. See
  documentation for deployment for more information on how to setup the
  application now.
- Static files of formbar are no longer copied into the static files of ringo
  on application start. These files are now dynamically loaded from formbar.
- Invoke command "formbar_static"

1.1.0
=====
New:
- Added "openmodal" option to LinkfieldRenderer
- Added "action" option to LinkfieldRenderer to be able to render other
  actions then read and update links.
- Added _get_permission classmethod in the Baseitem class. This class can be
  overwritten to implement a custom way to build the ACL for this class and
  instances.
- Added info page after login if the account has been disabled.
- Added --path option to load and save fixtures to be able to load alternative
  fixtures.
- Implement setting dot-separated values in items.
- Implemented fuzzy search. The search now supports the "~" operator to
  trigger a fuzzy search which uses the doublemetaphon as primary algorithm
  and falls back to the levenshtein algorithm as secondary it the primary
  fails.

Changed:
- Only show "Homepage" on index page if the user is actually logged in.
- Fixed DTListRenderer which was only rarly used and seems to be broken for
  some time. The fix onyl gets it working again. There is still work to do to
  make it work as the default ListRenderer (Display of Link e.g).
- Allow custom title and body in confirmation dialog.
- Use form parameter when getting the create form. Usefull when you want to
  use an alternative form to create an item.
- Hide attribute of ActionItems also affects overview lists.
- "ringo-admin modul add" command does not generate SQL code anymore. Instead
  of this it will print out code for the fixtures.
- Make the application base url configurable using the app.url config
  parameter.
- Added title tooltips in context menu
- Only save paths in the history and not full qualified URLs.


1.0.0
=====
WARNING! This update is a major upgrade of Ringo which may break your application!
It removes many of the core modules in the application! This will break your
application if you use one of the removed modules. In this case stay with the
0.18.0 version.

The following modules has been removed:

- Removed Log module
- Removed Tags module
- Removed Printtemplate module
- Removed Appointment module
- Removed Comments module
- Removed File module
- Removed News module
- Removed Todo module

The modules will be converted into extensions.

With version 0.16.2 Ringo supports loading extensions to enhance the
functionality of the application. This should be the default way to add
optional features to a Ringo based application. Since the removed modules all
implement general features which are optional to your application and aren't a
basic requirement, they has been removed from the core now. This reduces the
code base and make the core faster and more secure. The later is an important
precondition for post 1.0 goal: Getting much more secure to get ready to build
rock solid web application in Ringo.

New:
- Added Label field to the roles module.
- Added new "fixture" command in ringo-admin to load and save fixtures.
- Added new "revision" db command in ringo admin to generate a new
  (autogenerated) alembic migration script.
- Added fixtures for initial data.
- Support german locale in datefields. (Requires new formbar)
- Added showall option for Listfieldrenderer to show all elements regardless
  if the user is allowed to read the item. If the user is not allowed to read
  the item no link to open the item will be rendererd.
- When creating a new user a usergroup for the new user will be generatated
  automatically. The new usergroup will be set as default usergroup for the
  new user if no other group is set while creation.

Changed:
- The documentation is now opened in a new browser window instead of opening
  it in a modal popup window.
- Modal dialogs can not be closed by clicking in the background.
- Reimplemented openmodal function in listingfields. Has been removed by
  accident.
- Changed behaviour of the onlylinked attribute in listingfields. Also removes
  the checkboxes now as there is no reason to link/unlink items if only the
  linked items should be displayed.
- Improved user language detection in Javascript. Language setting is now
  determined by calling a remote function in the Rest API.
- The create method of factories now require a values attribute! It is not
  optional but can be empty to get the old behaviour.
- Show

Removed:
- Pre 1.0 Migration scripts removed. The older migrations scripts are now
  replaced by one single script. The alembic version of this version is still
  the same so that future migration scripts can be applied to old applications
  as well.

0.18.0
======
- Added option to open items in a modal window.
- Show spinner when opening items in a modal window.
- Set requirment of formbar to >= 0.9.4.
- Added 'url_prefix' and 'url_scheme' the server configuration in the template
  of the ini file in base scaffold. This is usefull if the server is running
  behind a reverse proxy.
- Added options to configure the startup of the ODFConverter. On default the
  converter is not started! This is a change to the previous behaviour!
- Loading data in ringo-admin command can optinally be done by using the ID of
  the item instead of the default UUID. This is usefull for initially loading
  data after creating a database in case not all entries in the database have
  a UUID.
- Add support for import and and export of NM-relations. (Experimental). To
  enable this feature simply add the --include-relations to the savedata
  command.
- Improved translations. Added missing calls to translate function at various
  places.
- Added experimental support for exanding values for dotted attributes (e.g
  relation.value).
- #77 Support alembic >= 0.7.1
  This will detect missing foreign keys in your datatable.
  Important:
  * Please update to a recent version of alembic (currently 0.7.4)
  * In case you are using SQLite: Merge
    ringo/alembic/versions/46edfd16f379_.py migration script to your migration
    scripts and apply it. See
    http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/branches.html for more details on
    merging. This will fix errors in the base ringo model.
  * Please generate a new migration and apply it. If your missing any foreign
    keys they will be generated now. If you are using SQLite please refer to
    ringo/alembic/versions/46edfd16f379_.py and see how migration is done for
    the base tables.
- #87 Remove alembic_sqlite dependeny.
  As alembic now supports some missing operations like add and drop column on
  SQLite the helper library alembic_sqlite is not needed anymore.
  Important:
  * Please search for the string "drop_column_default" and remove this and the
    following codeblock from your existing migration files.

	  expression. This is usefull for searches on dates.
- Improved exporting.
	- Added RecursiveRelation Exporter.
	- Added ODF Converter.
- Insert scaffold of a formdefinition when creating a new form.

0.16.0
======
Refactoring of views:
* Seperation of views: Basic views (LCRUDIE) are now located under
  views.base.list ... views.base.export. Removed views/base.py.
* Moved REST logic into the corresponding new view modules.
* Moved methods and code from views.json into the new views.api and
  views.response modules
* views.api: Modul with method used by the client.
* views.respose: Modul with special Response objects.
* views.request: Modul with methods (handlers) with common logic for various views.
* views.helpers : Modul with helpers methods (getters) to get things like to forms or
  information from the request.

Refactoring of model:
* Removal of the request dependecy in the base model.
  Refactoring of the setup of the modules.
* Removal of several class methods like get_action_routename and get_item
  actions into lib.helpers and others.

Refactoring of lib:

* Splitted large lib/renderer.py into various files under lib/renderer.

HOWTO Upgrade:

* The following methods has been moved:
  - get_table_config -> lib/table.py
  - get_form_config -> lib/form.py
  - get_action_routename -> lib/helpers.py
  - get_item_list -> model/base.py
  - get_item_modul -> lib/helpers.py

  Search for these methods in all *.py and *.mako files and adapt the call.

0.15.2
======
* Use app title instead of app name as prefix in subject of notification mails.
* Fix urls in import, export dialogs. Use get_current_route_patch instead of
  URL (causes errors with SSL behind an reverse proxy)
* Fix import. Handle NULL values correct for integers.
* Fix handling NULL values in sorting.
* Use new formbar version 0.9.0. Fix some rules.

* Fixed automatic translation in connection with mappings.
* Handle case if an attribute returns a BaseList as selected items in
  ListRenderer.

Changes:
* Text in News is now a Textarea.

0.15.0
=======
IMPORTANT: Application will need some work on application initialisation to
stay compatible with this release:

1. rename add_route to setup_modul
2. Move setup of modules into a "includeme" method.
3. Use config.include("appname") to call the includeme method.
4. setup_finished callback is removed.

- Changed the way how the routing is setup on application initialisation. Now
  iterate over all available modules from database and configure the routes
  for each modul instead hardcoding the configuration including importing the
  modules etc.
- Added new ringo-admin command.
- Removed old add-ringo-modul command.
- Automatic logout after a configurable time. Defaults to 1800sec. Some time
  before the loggout a warning dialog will be raised.
- Removed deprecated "ignore" filter for selections. Use must use filter now.
- Filter option and items Dropdowns and Listings (Listfield, Comments) on user permissions.
- Changed permission system. Add user roles to the user if the user is member
  of the items group. Added group roles additionally.
- Usergroups and Roles now have a description.
- Statemodel of forms only have two states now: Draft, Published
- Added support for Regular expressions in search (again). Now you can
  configure if the searchterm is a regular expression or not.

  error)

0.11.0
------
- Add service under "rest/rule/evaluate" to evaluate rules. Service is used

0.10.0
------
- Add new requirement of py3o.template library.
- Add Printtemplate modul. Printtemplates are ODT or ODS documents which are
  used as templates for generating nice looking documents. On processing the
  template placeholders in the template will be replaced by values of the
  item. The template can include basic python expressions. E.g to iterate over
  lists.

0.9.2
-----
- Add Versioned mixin. This mixin can be used to store different versions of
  an item. On each update of the item the serialized values of the item will
  be saved in the version table. The versions are later used to show
  differences between the current and a given prior version in the form.
- Add get_values function to the BaseItem to return a dictionary containing
  all values of the item. Optionally the items can be serialized (this
  is a very simple serialisation).
- Reorganised automatic logging and changing states. The former version was
  implemented as update handler in the mixin classes and was based
  on the SQLAlchemy "history" functionallity. Unfortunately this history
  wasn't as much reliable as expected in some corner cases. The update handler
  was removed and changing the states and logging are now implemented directly
  in the save method of the item.

0.9.1
-----
- Replaced route_url with route_path.
- Fixed rendering of links in the dropdown renderer. Consider user permission
  on link generation (read/update).
- Added options to the Table renderer to configure the responsive behaviour of
  table columns. You can now define which columns should be visible on which
  screenwidth. Defaults to show only the first column.
- Workded on Formeditor. Implemented selecting a form when creating new
  (blobform) items.
- Introduced warnings (formbar 393:bbd7a5192e29). Validate the item on loading
  to generate warning.
- Handlers in the statemachine now get the transition as additional parameter.
  This is usefull das the transformation gives access to the state,
  statemachine and optionally the request.
- Use sorting configuration from table config in DTLists.
- Added paginated DTList.
- Check if the user is still allowed to edit the item after he edited it
  (Statechange). If not call alternative read URL.
- Improved performance. Do some caching here and there.

0.7.0
-----

- Rows in DTLists are now clickable to if the user is allowed to update the
  item then the update action will be called on click. Else call the read action.
- Fix URLs for the ReST-Api to match basically the typical URL Schema for CRUD
  actions:

    * GET /items - Retrieves a list of items
    * GET /items/12 - Retrieves a specific item
    * POST /items - Creates a new item
    * PUT /items/12 - Updates item #12
    * PATCH /items/12 - Partially updates item #12
