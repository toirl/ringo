############
Installation
############

Ringo depends on some external libraries, like `Pyramid
<https://pylonsproject>`_, `SQLAlchemy <https://sqlalchemy.org>`_ and `Formbar <https://formbar.readthedocs.io>`_. Pyramid is a very general open source
Python web framework. SQLAlchemy is a very mature and powerfull ORM to get an
abstraction layer to your database. Formbar is a library to layout and handle
HTML forms in a easy way.

There are of course many ways to get this and other depended libraries
installed on your system. The most easy way is to install all this stuff into
an isolated :ref:`venv`.

**Prerequisites**

 * You will need a Python 2.7.* to get started.
 * PostgreSQL
 * Access to the internet to load depended packages.

The installation of Ringo is done in four steps. First we need to install
some :ref:`basicsupplement` which are needed later in the installation
process.
Second install a :ref:`venv` where all the python packages will be installed.
Third we need a DBMS and therefor install :ref:`installpostgresql`. Finally the last
step will :ref:`bootstrapenv`.

The following examples are tested on a Ubuntu 16.04 installation. 

.. _basicsupplement:

*************************
Basic supplement packages
*************************
*Curl* is used to fetch the bootstrap script which is used in the last step of
the installation.

*Git* is the SCM tool of choice for the Ringo development. To be able to
checkout the related packages during the bootstrap process you need to install
git.

Install all supplement packages::

        apt-get install curl git

.. _venv:

**********
Virtualenv
**********
A `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ is a isolated python
environment is used to install python packages independently from
your systems python environment. Using virtualenv you can setup unlimited number
of independent environments for your development.

Install the virtualenv using the package manger::

        apt-get install python-virtualenv

If you are not familiar with the use of a virtualenv then can have a look at
the `userguide of virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_.

.. _installpostgresql:

********
Postgres
********
Ringo requires a `Postgresql <https://www.postgresql.org>`_ database. Further
we need some development packages because python postgres driver will be build
on :ref:`bootstrapenv`.

Install Postgres the package manger::

        apt-get install postgresql
        apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-9.5 python-dev gcc

Now create a user in the database. This user should have the same name as the
user who is going to run the application later.  This user will be used to
connect to the database.  The uses must be allowed to create new databases. In
this example we create a user *ringo*::

        su postgres
        createuser -d ringo

This user and his credentials are later needed in den `*.ini` application
configuration to configure the db connection.

Even that Ringo uses a ORM such as SQLAlchemy Ringo currently relies on a
Postgresql database. This is mainly for historical reasons: There has been
times where the default database of Ringo was `SQlite
<http://www.sqlite.org>`_. But migrating the schema of the database during the
developement was a huge pain, because of its limited support of SQL commands.
Hower maybe this will change again in the future. If you want to help please
have a look at `the related issue
<https://github.com/ringo-framework/ringo/issues/23>`_


***************
Python3 support
***************
I'm sorry. Python 3 is currently not supported. Your help to port Ringo for
Python 3 is welcome!

Quickstart

.. _bootstrapenv:

*********************************
Bootstrap Development Environment
*********************************
To start with an empty development environemt do the follwing::

        apt-get install git
        curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ringo-framework/ringo/master/bootstrap-dev-env.sh
        sh bootstrap-dev-env.sh ringo

This command will generate a folder which includes some subfolder for the
virtualenv and needed libraries::

        ringo
        |-- env
        |   |-- ...
        |   `-- bin
        `-- lib
            |-- brabbel
            |-- formbar
            `-- ringo

The general layout of an development environment looks like this::

 * appname: Root folder of the environment. Usually named with the name of the
   application.
 * lib: Folder for libraries. To be able to have differen versions of the core
   libraries ringo and formbar I recommend to install the development version
   for each application.
 * env: The virtual python environment.

.. _minimalapp:

*********************
A minimal Application
*********************

Activate the virtualenv and change into you development environment::

        cd /path/to/your/development/environment
        source env/bin/activate

Create a fresh application based on a ringo project template::

        pcreate -t ringo foo
        mv foo src
        cd src
        python setup.py develop

Optional: Setup the database connection in the generated *development.ini*
file and configure the user you created in the process of installing
:ref:`installpostgresql`. If you followed the instructions you're done and no
further action is needed. However here is an example how to change the
connection to database.::

        -sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://@/foo
        +sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:password@localhost/foo 

Create a new database for your application and initialise the database using
the :ref:`clidb`::

        createdb foo
        foo-admin db init

Start the application::

        pserve --reload development.ini

******************************
Extending existing Application
******************************
Ringo allows to build applications which are based on another application.
I will call it `baseapp` from now on.
This needs some further steps after you created a single application as
described in :ref:`minimalapp`.

You need to add the baseapp into your requirements file.

After creating the application you need to modify the `__init__.py` file of
your application to include the configuration of the baseapp application::

        # Include basic ringo configuration.
        config.include('ringo')
        config.include('baseapp')
        config.include('yourapp')
        for extension in extensions:
            config.include(extension)
        ...
        config.scan('baseapp')
        config.scan()
        
If you also have overwritten views in your baseapp application you must also 
scan the foo package. Otherwide you application is not aware of these overwritten 

In your `ini` file you need to set the base of your new application::

        app.base = baseapp

In your `ini` file you need to add the directories for the mako templates::

        # mako template settings
        mako.directories =
            yourapp:templates
            baseapp:templates
            ringo:templates
        mako.default_filters = h

`baseapp` is the name of the application which you want to use as a base.
`yourapp` is the name of the application you are creating.

In order to have a working migration setup you will need to import the
model of the base appliction to the model of the inherited application::

       import bar.model

This will ensure that all the model will be available to alembic. Otherwise
many tables would be scheduled for a drop.

The initialisation of the database is a little bit different as we want to
initialize the database with the migration scripts and fixtures of baseapp::

        bar-admin db init --base baseapp
        bar-admin fixtures load --app baseapp

While the migration scripts are copied from baseapp to yourap when initialising the
database for the first time, the fixtures are not! yourapp only
includes the fixtures from the base ringo application. If you want to use the
fixtures from baseapp on default, then you need to copy the files yourself::

        rm </path/to/yourapp/yourapp/fixtures/*
        cp -r <path/to/baseapp/baseapp/fixtures/* </path/to/yourapp/yourapp/fixtures


VoilÃ ! That is it.

************************************
How to make config changes permanent
************************************
Ringo allows to change the configuration of the application through the UI in
many ways. You can add new roles, set permissions etc. All those changes are
done in the database.
As those changes will get lost when dropping and recreating the database we
need a way to make save these changes in a way that they do not get lost when
reinitialize the application.

The typical way is to write a migration script and to put the changes you made
into this script. An empty migration script can be generated like this::

        ringo-admin db revision

An easy way to get the changes in the database is to diff between the dump of
the database. On dump is done before the changes are mare::

        DB=ringo
        pg_dump -a --column-inserts $DB | grep INSERT > $DB.dump.pre

Now you can do the changes in the application and dump the database again::

        pg_dump -a --column-inserts $DB | grep INSERT > $DB.dump.post

Finally you diff the two dumps and ideally get the changes made in the
database ready to put into the migration script::

        diff $DB.dump.pre $DB.dump.post | grep INSERT | sed -e 's/> //g' > inserts.sql


*****************
Work with modules
*****************

.. _add_modul:

Add a new modul
===============

Please make sure you understand the concept of :ref:`modules` before adding a
new module. In some cases it might be sufficient to only :ref:`add_view`.

First you create the initial files and a migration to "install" the module in
your application using the :ref:`climod` command. Please use the singular form
of the name of the module::

        ringo-admin modul add <modulname in singular form>

This will generate a bunch of files:

 * A model file
 * A XML configuration for the form configuration
 * A JSON configuration for the overview/listing configuration
 * A migration file to install the modul.

Upgrade the database to apply the generated migration and to install the
initial data for the module by using the :ref:`clidb` command::

        ringo-admin db upgrade

The module is now installed and ready for use. Restart your application. The
module should now be listed in the main menu. You can already call all CRUD
actions of the module, but for now no data is saved as the model of the module
is basically empty. So its time to add some fields to your new module.


Add new fields
==============
Adding new fields to the module means finally means adding new fields to the
model of the module and finally to do a migration.

There are two ways to to this:

 1. You do all the work on your own and add the fields directly in the model file of your module. If you want to choose this way I recommend reading the `SQLAlchemy documentation on Decalaritve Mapping <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/mapping_styles.html#declarative-mapping>`_

 2. You focus on developing the form of the module and let Ringo generate the relevant part of the model your you. This way you only need to copy and paste the generated model code into your model. If you choose this way than you should become familiar with the :ref:`formconfig` (Which is a crucial part of Ringo development anyway).

Whatever way you choose it finally ends in the generating a migration file
and upgrading the database using the :ref:`clidb` command::

        ringo-admin db revision
        ringo-admin db upgrade

Build relations between modules
===============================
Adding a relation between two modules is usually done in two steps:

 1. Add fields to the model for the foreign key and add an ORM relation.
 2. Migrate the database.

Here is a short example from `ringo/model/user.py`::

        class User(BaseItem, Owned, Base):
                ...
                sid = sa.Column(sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('user_settings.id'))
                # user_settings is the name of the table in the database for
                # the settings. This field refers to the id column of that
                # table.
                ...
                settings = sa.orm.relationship("UserSetting", uselist=False,
                                               cascade="all,delete")
                # UserSetting is the name of the Python class to which the
                relation is set.

If you want to use this relation later in forms than you must refer to the
`settings` attribute of the User and **not** to foreign key.

There is nothing specific in Ringo on adding a foreign key and a relation to
the model so all relevant information can be found in the `ORM
documentation <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/basic_relationships.html>`_ of SQLAlchemy.

.. tip::
        If you have a bidirectional relation between to modules we recommend
        to set up the ORM relation in both modules instead of using the
        *backlink* feature of SQLAlchemy. Writing to relations tends to be
        better readable esspecially when it comes to cascading rules.

.. _add_mixin:

Extend modul with a mixin
=========================
Please make sure you understand the concept of :ref:`mixins` before extending the module. In some cases it might be sufficient to only :ref:`add_view` or :ref:`add_action`.


.. index::
   single: CRUD
   single: Action
   single: Bundle
   single: Bundled Action

.. _add_action:

Add a new action to a modul
===========================
Initially each module has only the default :ref:`crud` actions available.
However the module can be extended by adding a new specific action.

In the following example we will add a `foo` action to the `bar` module.

Action entry
------------

Get the modul id of the `bar` modul from the database::

        select id from modules where name = 'bar';
        -> 1000

Get the max id in the actions table::

        select max(id) from actions;
        -> 118

Add a new action entry for this module in the database. Create a new migration
file for this::

        ringo-admin db revision

Open the new generated migration file and add the following statement to
upgrade the database. Use the modul id
and the next id of the action entry::

        INSERT INTO actions (id, mid, name, url, icon, description, bundle, display, permission) 
        VALUES (119, 1000, 'Foo', 'foo/{id}', 'icon-eye-read', '', false, '', '');

.. note::
        If you want to add a action which should also be available as a
        bundled action (selectable from the dropdown on the overview page) you
        need to set the `bundle` attribute to 'true'.

Find details on the values for the action entry in `ActionItem source
<https://github.com/ringo-framework/ringo/blob/master/ringo/model/modul.py#L46>`_


Don't forget to add the statement to downgrade the migration as well::

        DELETE FROM actions where id = 119;

After manual inserting a new action entry in the database you need to fix the
sequences in the database::

        ringo-admin db fixsequence


View
----
Create a new callable for the `foo` action. Usually this is done in the
`/views/bar.py`::

        from pyramid.view import view_config
        from ringo.lib.helpers import get_action_routename

        from myapp.model.bar import Bar 

        @view_config(route_name=get_action_routename(Bar, "foo"),
                     renderer="/foo.mako")
        def my_foo_view(request):
            # Implement logic here.
            return {}

Bundle view
-----------
This is an example of a simple bundled action::

        from ringo.lib.helpers import get_action_routename
        from ringo.views.base.list_ import set_bundle_action_handler
        from ringo.views.request import is_confirmed
        from ringo.lib.renderer import (
                ConfirmDialogRenderer,
                InfoDialogRenderer
        )

        from myapp.model.bar import Bar

        def my_bundle_view(request, items, callback=None):
            if (request.method == 'POST' and
                is_confirmed(request)):
                    for item in items:
                        pass # Do the action for each item here.
                    renderer = InfoDialogRenderer(request, "Title", "Body")
                    rvalue = {}
                    rvalue['dialog'] = renderer.render(url=request.route_path(get_action_routename(Bar, "list")))
                    return rvalue
            else:
                renderer = ConfirmDialogRenderer(request, Bar, "foo", "Title")
                rvalue = {}
                rvalue['dialog'] = renderer.render(items)
                return rvalue

        set_bundle_action_handler("foo", my_bundle_view)

This bundled action will show a confirmation dialog which needs to be
confirmed. After that the view will iterate over all selected items and show a
info dialog at the end.

Permissions
-----------
Modifications on the permissions should be done in a migration script::

        ringo-admin db revision

So here are the required steps to craft the needed INSERT and DELETE
statements.

First get the id of the role which should be able to call the action::

       SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'users';
       -> 2

Now SQL statements for the migration script will be::

        INSERT INTO nm_actions_roles (aid, rid) VALUES (119, 2);
        DELETE FROM nm_actions_roles WHERE aid = 119 and rid = 2;

As always when manually inserting something in the database call the
fixsequence command::

        ringo-admin db fixsequence/gp_dump


Setup breadcrumbs
=================
Breadcrumbs are a great way to help users to navigate through a nested set of
related modules and alway show them where they are.

Ringo can show breadcrumbs. They are optional. If you want them you need to
configure a `Sitemap`. The sitemap is build in the *__init__.py* file of your
application::

        from ringo.lib.sitetree import site_tree_branches
        sitetree = { your sitetree configureation goes here }
        site_tree_branches.append(sitetree)

For a detailed description on how to build a see the documentation of the
sitetree module.

.. rubric:: Sitetree module

.. automodule:: ringo.lib.sitetree

********************
Work with extensions
********************

Add a new extension
======================

The following commands will create a new extension namend "evaluation" and
install it in your system to make it available for other applications::

    pcreate -t ringo_extension evaluation
    cd evaluation 
    python setup.py develop

If your extension provides some extension specific actions they should be
implemented in a Extension Mixin class. Overwrite the 'get_mixin_actions'
method to define the actions the extension should provide to other modules::

        class Evaluable(Mixin):

            @classmethod
            def get_mixin_actions(cls):
                actions = []
                # Add Evaluation action
                action = ActionItem()
                action.name = 'Evaluate'
                action.url = 'evaluate/{id}'
                action.icon = 'glyphicon glyphicon-stats'
                action.permission = 'read'
                action.bundle = True
                actions.append(action)
                return actions



Use an extension
================

Adding a extension into your application, and making it available for later
coding basically consists of two basic steps:

1. Register the extension in the application. This first
   registration may include modifications of your datamodel.

2. In case of changes in the datamodel, these changes must be made
   reproducable for later installations. This is done by writing a migration
   script.


.. rubric:: Register the extension

First create a backup of your current database! Registering a extension in
your application may involve modifications of the database. Having a backup is
a good idea anyway but also in important step to be able to see changes made
while registering.

The example assumes using a PostgreSQL database.

Here we go. First backup your database and ensure you acually have the data in
form of `INSERT` statements::

    pg_dump -a --column-inserts efa | grep INSERT > efa.dump.pre

Now register your extension in your application. Registering is done in three
steps.

In the model/__init__.py file of your application::

        import os
        from ringo.model import Base, extensions
        from ringo.lib import helpers
        
        extensions.append("ringo_news")
        
        # Dynamically import all model files here to have the model available in
        # the sqlalchemy metadata. This is needed for the schema migration with
        # alembic. Otherwise the migration will produce many table drops as the
        # tables of the models are not present in the metadata

In case your extention provides custom templates you need to configure an
additional search path for your templates in the ini file::

        # mako template settings
        mako.directories = ringo:templates
        mako.directories = ringo_evaluation:templates

Now start your application. You will notice a warning on the startup saying
that you are missing a modul entry for the new registered application::

        2016-01-15 08:49:06,652 WARNI [ringo.lib.extension][MainThread]
        Extension 'news' is missing a entry in DB. Missing migration?

For now we will initially create these entries in the database by invoking the
following command::

        ringo-admin app add-extension ringo_news

This command will add the initial entries for the extension in your database.
It time find out what actually has been added to the database to be able to
readd these modification later in the migration script::

        pg_dump -a --column-inserts efa | grep INSERT > efa.dump.post
        diff efa.dump.pre efa.dump.post | grep INSERT | sed -e 's/> //g' > inserts.sql

The file `inserts.sql` include the modification in your database to register
the extension.

The next startup of your application will show that the extension has been
loaded::

        2016-01-15 08:59:06,639 INFO  [ringo.lib.extension][MainThread]
        Extension 'news' OK

Registration is finished with this step. You now must create a migration
script to add futher tables in your database and to make the registration of
the modul persistent.

.. rubric:: Create an initial migration script

A migration script is used to make the registration and modification of the
database by the extension persistent. So you can install the application later
without doing these steps over and over again.

Lets begin with creating a new migration script by invoking the following
command::command::

        efa-admin db revision

This creates a migration script and in case the extension adds new tables to
your application the migration also include migration to add these tables.

Now add the dumped SQL statements from the `inserts.sql` into the new
generated migration script to make the registration of the new extension
happen completly in the migration script and new application can be setup in
one single step.


.. rubric:: What next?

After you registered the extension and make the changes persistent in a
migration script its time to use the extensions functionallity.

How to use the extension is heavily depended on its type. Please refer to the
extensions documention for further information. But here is a general hint:

Many extension allow to enhance the functionallity of your existing modules by
using Mixins. In case of the `ringo_tags` extension you can make modules
tagable by inheriting the `Tabable` Mixin class::

        class MyClass(Tagable, ..., BaseItem, Base):

Often these mixins require further database migration to add relations to your
model. You will need to create seperate migration scripts again by using the
`ringo-admin db revision` command.


.. _formconfig:

******************
Form configuration
******************
Form configuration is done in XML files. Configurations are stored in
`<yourproject>/views/forms/` folder.

Ringo uses the `formbar <https://formbar.readthedocs.io>`_ library
for form handling.it gives you plenty of nice features like easy design,
validation, conditional fields and rule expressions to only name some of them.

.. tip::
        You can easily add fields to the form, change the layout and see the
        results immediately when you reload the page. This is a great help
        when you design forms. The only restriction to this is storing the
        data and doing 

Using formbar
=============
Please have a look into the `formbar documentation <https://formbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to learn how to configure forms using formbar and check the forms in `ringo/views/forms` for some examples.

Generate model fields
=====================
After you have added new fields to the form you need to add those fields to
the model too. Ringo provides a small helper command for this which will
generate the relevant fields from the given form for your model::

        ringo-admin modul fields <name of modul in plural form>

This will print some code to *stdout* which can be pasted into the model of
the module.

Don't forget to generate migration and upgrade the database::

        ringo-admin db revision
        ringo-admin db upgrade

Ringo specific renderer
=======================
Ringo comes with some specific renderers which extends the default renderers
of formbar. They usually are aware of accessing to Ringo specific attributes
like permissions checks e.g.

.. index::
   triple: Form;Renderer;Checkbox

Checkbox
--------
.. autoclass:: ringo.lib.renderer.form.CheckboxFieldRenderer

.. index::
   triple: Form;Renderer;Dropdown

Dropdown
--------
.. autoclass:: ringo.lib.renderer.form.DropdownFieldRenderer

.. index::
   triple: Form;Renderer;Links

Links
-----
.. autoclass:: ringo.lib.renderer.form.LinkFieldRenderer

.. index::
   triple: Form;Renderer;Listings

Listings
--------
.. autoclass:: ringo.lib.renderer.form.ListingFieldRenderer

State
-----
.. autoclass:: ringo.lib.renderer.form.StateFieldRenderer


Writing a new renderer
======================
Ringo let you easily define your own custom renderer. Custom renderers are
used to display the data in a free defined form. You can define new input
elements or present you data in diagram e.g.

Writing an using custom renderers is done in two steps:

 1. You write the renderer and templates
 2. You bind in the new renderer in the application

Renderer part
-------------
First create a new renderer by ineriting from an existing one. Formbar and
Ringo already provide some renderers which can be used. Renderers are usally
located in `lib/renderer.py` or `lib/renderer/form.py`.

Here you see the code for a simple renderer::

        import os
        import pkg_resources
        from mako.lookup import TemplateLookup
        from formbar.renderer import FieldRenderer
        from ringo.lib.renderer.form import renderers

        # We need to configure the template lookup system and "register" a new
        # location of the templates. Mako will search in this locations for
        # templates to render.
        base_dir = pkg_resources.get_distribution("namofapplication").location
        template_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'nameofapplication', 'templates')
        template_lookup = TemplateLookup(directories=[template_dir],
                                         default_filters=['h'])

        # Now create your renderer. And define the template which is used on
        # rendering.
        class MyFieldRenderer(FieldRenderer):

            def __init__(self, field, translate):
                FieldRenderer.__init__(self, field, translate)
                self.template = template_lookup.get_template("path/to/field/template.mako")


        # Finally register the template in ringo to make the renderer known in
        # formbar.
        renderers['myrenderer'] = Myfieldrenderer

A template looks like this::
        
        <div id="${field.id}">
                I'm the body of your field with name ${field.name}. In
                ${field._form} which is there to render fields of
                ${field._form._item} with renderer ${field.renderer}. Add
                content here.
        </div>


View part
---------
Using the new renderer is about configuring the renderer for an entity::

        <entity ...>
                <renderer type="myrenderer"/>
        </entity>

The type of the renderer is the name of the renderer under which it has been
registered in ringo.

Using forms in views
====================
Here is some pseudo code to get the idea. In the first step you need to get
the form::

        from ringo.views.helpers import (
                get_item_form, 
                render_item_form
        )
        from ringo.views.request import (
                handle_POST_request,
                handle_redirect_on_success
        )


        # This is currently hackish :( A form needs the class and the item.
        # This is usally part of the request already in case of the defalt CRUD
        # actions. If we have a custom view we need to set those attributes in
        # the request for ourself.
        request.context.__model__ = ItemClass 
        request.context.item = item

        form = get_item_form('nameoftheform', request)

Now we need to handle POST request of the form in case we actually want to
save data and not only render the form. We use standard Ringo functionality
for this::

        if request.POST:
                if handle_POST_request(form, request):
                        url = request.route_patch("nameofthisroute")
                        return handle_redirect_on_success(request, backurl=url)

        # In all other cases render the form. It's now up to you to return the
        # rendererd form to the template.
        rendered_form = render_item_form(request, form)


**********************
Overview configuration
**********************

.. autoclass:: ringo.lib.table.TableConfig

Fields
======
Customs rendering
-----------------
Sometimes you may want to render some information of the item in a different
way. This is possible by setting the `renderer` config option and writing a
custom render function.

Example field configuration::

        {"name": "field", "label": "Fieldname", "renderer": "foo.bar.myrenderer"}

The field `field` must exist to prevent warnings while rendering the overview.
However the field does not really matter here as the renderer will get
all informations you may need to to a nice rendering.
The `renderer` refers to a callable which is defined like this::

        from ringo.lib.helpers import literal

        def myrenderer(request, item, column, tableconfig):
	    # Depending where where this method is called the item is 
	    # either a tuple or the item. If it is called from the 
	    # ListfieldRenderer the item is a tuple
	    if isinstance(item, tuple):
	        item = item[0]
		
            # Do the renderering. In case you return HTML do not forget to
            # escape all values properly and finally return a literal.
            return literal("<strong>Hello world!</strong>")

********************
Overwriting defaults
********************
The behaviour of the application can be modified in different ways. You can
customize the **layout** of forms, overviews and or the whole page layout and
you can customize the **logic** of your application.

There are basically two ways to customize your application:

 1. Overwriting defaults to customize existing behavior.
 2. Extending existing application logic


.. rubric:: Defaults in Ringo

If you have created a new application you may wonder that there are so less
files generated. There are no views generated, no templates and you can not
find any static files.

There reason for that is that ringo is using its defaults for the new
application: 

 1. Views for all modules including the basic CRUD actions has been configured
     on application start. They all use the base default actions defined in
     Ringo.
 2. Templates, form configurations, overview configuration and translations
     are searched in different locations. Actually on each request ringo tries
     to load a more specific version of a template but falls back to the ringo
     default as long as it can not find a

So if you want to customize your application you can overwrite the default.

Overwriting views
=================
Application logic is defined in the view function. The view for specific
actions can be overwritten.  In the following example we will overwrite the
default 'index' method of the 'home' view, but this also works for the CRUD
actions of a module. Define your custom method in your view file::

        @view_config(route_name='home', renderer='/index.mako')
        def index_view(request):
            # Write your own logic here.
            handle_history(request)
            values = {}
            ...
            return values

Note, that we reconfigure the view by calling 'view_config' with an already
configured route_name. This will overwrite the configured view and the
application will use your custom view now for the route named 'home'.

If you only want to extend the functionallity from the default you can do this
too. No need to rewrite the default logic again in your custom view::

        from ringo.views.home import index_view as ringo_index_view

        @view_config(route_name='home', renderer='/index.mako')
        def index_view(request):
            # First call the default view.
            values = ringo_index_view(request)
            # Now extend the logic.
            ...
            # Finally return the values.
            return values

.. rubric:: Using callbacks in the views

Callbacks can be used to implement custom application logic after the logic of
the default view has been processed. This is usefull e.g if you want to send
notification mails, modifiy values after a new item has been created or clean
up things after something has been deleted.

A callback has the following structure::

        def foo_callback(request, item):
            """
            :request: Current request
            :item: Item which has been created, edited, deleted...
            :returns item
            """
            # Do something with the item and finally return the item.
            return item

The request and the item should give you all the context you should need to to the
desired modifications.

The callback must be supplied in the call of the main view function like
this::

        @view_config(route_name=Foo.get_action_routename('create'),
                renderer='/default/create.mako',
                permission='create')
        def create(request):
                return create_(Foo, request, callback=foo_callback)

.. versionadded:: 1.2.2
        The callback can now optionally be a list of callback functions. This
        can be used to stack multiple callbacks.

Overwriting static files 
========================
Static files are templates, form and overview configurations.
To overwrite the default simply copy the file from ringo into your application
with the same name at the same location. Now you can do the modifications in
the copied file. 

.. hint::
        In case you want to overwrite the forms checkout formbars inheritance
        and include feature if you only want to do small changes.

After that restart ringo so that ringo knows about new files
it should consider to load. On the next request you application should load
the overwritten version of the file.


Overwriting translations

.. _add_view:

************
Adding views
************
There is almost no ringo specific magic on adding new views to the application
to implement new functionality. Adding new views is basically pure Pyramid as
described in the `Pyramid documentation on view configuration
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/viewconfig.html#adding-view-configuration-using-the-view-config-decorator>`_. 

So just create a new view callable and configure it with the '@view_config'::

        from pyramid.view import view_config

        @view_config(route_name='fooroute', renderer='/foo.mako')
        def foo(request):
                # Do the work and return values which are available in the
                # template as # dictionary
                return {}

and add the route configuration in the '__init__.py' file of your
application::

        config.add_route('fooroute', 'path/to/foo/view')

Often you want to to do something with items of a modul. When using a simple
view the item is not already part of the request on default. This can be
changed by defining a ressource factory which will load the item. In the following
example a `Foo` item with the given id in the URL will be loaded and is 
available in the item as `request.item`.::

        from ringo.resources import get_resource_factory
        from app.model.foo import Foo

        config.add_route('fooroute', 'path/to/foo/view/{id}',
                         factory=get_resource_factory(Foo))


The `home.py view
<https://github.com/ringo-framework/ringo/blob/master/ringo/views/home.py>`_
is a good starting point to see how a simple view is added to Ringo.

However there are some limitations on views. This is because they are not so deeply
integrated into the ringo framework. They are a quick way to add some
functionality which the following drawbacks:

1. Permissions to call the view can not configured by setting permissions in
   the rolesystem. Permission checks need to be implemented within the view.
   See :ref:`add_view_permission` for more details.

2. The view can not be displayed in the action bundle, or the context menu of
   a single item. You need to make the view available by either adding a
   link in a template (:ref:`add_view_totemplate`) or as button in the form
   (:ref:`add_view_toform`) on your own.

If one or more points are crucial for you then you might want to 
:ref:`add_action`.

.. _add_view_permission:

Setting permissions
====================
Permisson related methods are defined in `lib.security`.
Here is an example of how to check if the current user is allowed to read a
certain item::

        import pyramid.httpexceptions as exc
        from ringo.lib.security import has_permission
        from app.model.foo import Foo

        def foo(request):
            item_id = request.params.get("id")
            factory = Foo.get_item_factory()
            item = factory.load(item_id)
            # You can check for one of the known CRUD actions. It will be
            checked against the permissions of the current user in the
            request.
            if not has_permission("read", item, request):
                raise exc.HTTPForbidden()
            # continue...
            return {}

Make sure you do the permission check as the very first thing in the view.

.. _add_view_toform:

Call view from within forms
===========================
Calling a view in the form is basically done in the same way as described in
:ref:`add_view_totemplate`. You will utilize the `HtmlRenderer of formbar
<http://formbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#html>`_ to render the
link.


.. _add_view_totemplate:

Call view from template
=======================
Assuming you have configured a new view with the routename `myroutename` than
the example code to render a link as a button in the following goes like this::

        <a href="${request.route_path('myroutename')}" class="btn btn-primary">Click me</a> 

********************
Custom authorisation
********************
If you need to change the way Ringo builds the ACL on default you can change this behavior by 
overwriting the ``_get_permissions`` class method of the BaseItem in your model::

    from pyramid.security import Allow

    @classmethod
    def _get_permissions(cls, modul, item, request):

        # Default ACL. Direct access
        permissions = BaseItem._get_permissions(modul, item, request)

        # The default permissions are configured using the setting from the
        # roles. We can now modifiy/extend the default permissions. In the
        # following example we allow of users with role "foo" to read the
        # item
        permissions.append((Allow, 'role:foo', 'read'))

        # An alternativ can be to allow a specific user (by its id/uid) to
        # access the item
        if has_role(request.user, 'foo'):
            uid = request.user.id 
            permissions.append((Allow, 'uid:{}'.format(uid), 'read'))

        return permissions

Ownership inheritance
=====================
It is possible inherit the ownership (uid, gid) of a element from a
related element when *saving* the item. Inheritance of ownership means to
set the ownership of the item based on the  ownership of another item
and **not** with the uid, gid of the current user or other permission
settings like default groups.

.. note::
    Setting the inherited uid or gid only happens when saving the item
    explicit using the `save` method of the BaseItem. On default this is
    only the case when creating new items.

A typicall usecase is to grant users access to the item if they are
allowed to access a related (often parent) item by inheriting the uid
and gid.

To inherit the ownership you must set a special attribute in the model::

    class Foo(BaseItem):
        _inherit_gid = "parent"
        _inherit_uid = "parent"

        ...
        parent = sa.orm.relation(Bar)

You need to define the name of the relation to the item where the uid
and gid will be taken from. Please note that you can also set only one
of the attibutes.

***********************************
Inheritance from other applications
***********************************
Lets say you have a appliation called ''Foo'' which should be used as a
platform in the same way as ringo was a platform for the ''Foo'' application.
Now you want to create an application ''Bar'' based on ''Foo''.

The procedure to this is almost the same despite three things.

1. After creating the application you need to modify the `__init__.py` file of
your application to include the configuration of the ''Foo'' application::

        # Include basic ringo configuration.
        config.include('ringo')
        config.include('foo')
        config.include('bar')
        for extension in extensions:
            config.include(extension)
        ...
        config.scan('foo')
        config.scan()
        
If you also have overwritten views in your ''Foo'' application you must also 
scan the foo package. Otherwide you application is not aware of these overwritten 
methods.

2. The search path for the mako templates need to be extended as we want the
templates of the ''Foo'' application in our application too::

        # mako template settings
        mako.directories =
                bar:templates
                foo:templates
                ringo:templates

3. In order to have a working migration setup you will need to import the
model of the base appliction to the model of the inherited application::

       import bar.model

This will ensure that all the model will be available to alembic. Otherwise
many tables would be scheduled for a drop.

4. Set the configuration variable `app.base` to ''foo''.
See :ref:`config_app_base` for more details.

5. The initialisation of the database is a little bit different as we want to
initialize the database with the migration scripts and fixtures of ''Foo''::

        bar-admin db init --base foo
        bar-admin fixtures load --app foo

While the migration scripts are copied from foo to bar when initialising the
database for the first time, the fixtures are not! The bar application only
includes the fixtures from the base ringo application. If you want to use the
fixtures from foo on default, then you need to copy the files yourself::

        rm </path/to/bar/>/bar/fixtures/*
        cp -r <path/to/foo/>/foo/fixtures/* </path/to/bar/>/bar/fixtures


VoilÃ ! That is it.

*************************
Internationalisation I18n
*************************
Ringo uses the `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ package for handling the message catalogs. Translation of Ringo and Ringo based applications can be done with the following steps.
First move into your application root folder and invoke the following command to extract all messages which should be translated::
    
	python setup.py extract_messages
	
This will generate a new pot-File. Now update the catalogs of the different languages. Please note the '-N' flag to tell babel to be not to smart about fuzzy strings in the translation::
	
	python setup.py update_catalog -N
	
It is now time to edit the generated message catalaog and to put in the missing translations. Finally call the following command to actually compile the translations and to make them available in your application::
	
	python setup.py compile_catalog
	
Further information of the process of internationalisation in a Pyramid application can be found on `i18n in Pyramid <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/i18n.html>`_
	
.. Ringo translation is managed using `the Transifex webservice <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ringo/>`_

Under the hood
##############

.. image:: images/applayers.png
   :alt: Layermodel of Ringo.

Ringo is a Pyramid based application which can be extended to build your own
applications. This is a layered architecture where Pyramid brings in the basic
functionality like session handling and handling requests and responses in web
applications.  Ringo sits on top of Pyramid and provides commonly used
functionality often used in modern web applications.

.. note::

   Ringo is also a standalone application. You do not need to build another
   application on top of ringo to get something working to get an impression
   of ringo or start developing. Ringo is under steady development. This is a
   benefit if you use Ringo as base for your application. Your application
   will get bug fixes, new features or improved functionality in most cases by
   simply updating Ringo to a new version.

Ringo itself uses some external libraries to provide some of its
functionality. E.g the formbar library is used to build all forms and do
validation. The access to the database is done with the ORM SQLAlchemy.

A ringo based application is another pyramid based application which basically
extends ringo. See `Exending An Existing Pyramid Application
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/extending.html>`_
for more details on how this is done.

All this magic is already done in a pyramid scaffold which comes with ringo.
Using this scaffold will create an application which uses ringo functionality
by simply importing it at the right places and take care the basic
configuration is done in the proper way.

.. _modules:

*******
Modules
*******
The term "Module" is central and often used in ringo. Therefore it is important
to understand what a module is.

In short: Ringo's functionality is the sum of all modules
functionality. Ringo or a ringo based application can be extended by adding
new modules. If there is any data in the application which needs to be created
by the user and stored permanently in the database it is very likely done
within a modul.

**Example:** Think of an application to organise your orders in a shopping
application e.g. So you will have to store customers, articles, orders, prices,
addresses etc. Each of those will be its own modul.

.. image:: images/modules.png
   :alt: Schema of a module.

A module provides the infrastructure to work with a certain type of data in a
web application. Where certain type of data means users, files, movies etc.
rather than integers or datevalues. Lets call them items from now on.

Basically a module consists of

 * a model for the items you want to work with
 * views to handle incoming request and generating the proper responses for
 * templates which define how the pages in the application will look like. 
 * configuration files to define how the forms and overview tables will look like.

.. _crud:

CRUD actions
============
Modules provide actions which can be used to manipulate the item of a module.
Ringo provides some basic CRUD [#]_ actions which are available on default for every module.

* Create: Create new items.
* Read: Show the item in detail in readonly mode.
* Update: Edit items of the module.
* Delete: Deleting items.
* List: Listing all items of the module. This is slightly different to the action to read a single item.
* Import (CSV, JSON)
* Export (CSV, JSON)

.. [#] CRUD means: Create, Read, Update, Delete

Security
********
Security is an important aspect of ringo. This chapter will describe the
permission system and explains how ringo handle common security threats.

.. _permissionsystem:

Permission System
=================
The permission system addresses two basic questions:

1. **Who is allowed** to access some item in general and
2. **What is allowed** for the user to access, in case he is generally allowed
   to access the item.

To answer these two questions the permission system of Ringo is a combination
of concepts of the permission system known from the `Unix file system  <http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions>`_ and a
`roles based permission system <http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control>`_.

.. image:: images/permissions.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Activity diagram of the permission check.

The Unix file system part answers the first question: Who is allowed? Therefor
every item in the system inherited from the :ref:`mixin_owned` stores
information to which owner and which group it belongs to. Only the owner,
members of the group or users with an administrational role are granted access
to the item in general.

After the permission to access the item in general is allowed, the role bases
system answers the second question: What is allowed. The permission system
will now check which :ref:`roles` the users have and which actions are allowed for
these roles.

If the user is the owner of the item, or is member of the items group, then
all permissions of the users roles will be applied.

   double: Authentification;Roles
.. _roles:

Roles
-----

.. autoclass:: ringo.model.user.Role


.. _authentification:

Authentification
----------------
Authentication is done once in the login process. If the user has logged in
successful an auth cookie is saved. From then on the user object is loaded
from the database on every request with the roles and groups attached to the
user.  This user object is used later for the Authorisation. If the user is
not logged in the user object is empty.

The authentification has a default timeout of 30min. The timeout will be reset
after every new request of the user. The timeout can be configured in the
application configuration bei setting the 'auth.timeout' config variable.

.. index::
   double: Authentification;Anonymous Access
.. _authorisation:

Anonymous Authentification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On default Ringo does not provide an anonymous access to the application
(Despite of some static pages). So you must login before you can work with the
application and have appropriate permissions.

Anonymous access in Ringo is implemented by using a Proxy-User. This user must
be existent in the database and properly configured. To enable anonymous
access to the application you must configure this user as anonymous user. See
:ref:`anonymous_access` for more details.

If enabled every request to the application will automatically be 
authenticated with the configured anonymous user (As long as the User is not 
already logged in). The request will be done with all configured permissions 
of the roles the configured anonymous has. So you can configure in details 
which permissions a anonymous user will have.

.. warning::
        Be careful with the configuration of the anonymous user. Double check
        the permissions of the anonymous user and check the configuration in
        the ini file and make sure you did not configure a high privileged
        user like the admin as anonymous user.

To implement an anonymous access to the application you will need to do
three things:

1. Create a dedicated user which will be used as the anonymous user.
2. Create roles with appropriate permissions on the different modules to
   grant this anonymous user access on the data. Please note, that these
   roles must be "admin"  roles to disable the owner/group check on
   authorisation as we want the anonymous user to be able to basically
   all items. The only restriction is than configured by the permissions
   of the role.
3. Enable this anonymous user in the `ini` file.

Authorisation
-------------
The permission system in Ringo uses the Pyramid `Pyramid Authorisation and
Authenfication API <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/security.html>`_

Authorisation is done on every request. The authorisation will check if the
user is allowed to access the requested resource.

A resource is an url or an item which is accessed by calling the url in your
application.  In all cases this resource is build from a resource factory for
every request.  Every resource will have an ACL which determines if the user of
the current request (See :ref:`authentification`) is allowed to access the
resource.

Ringo's part in the authorisation process is to build the ACL. This ACL is
then used by the Pyramid security API. Therefor ringo implements helper
functions to build ACL lists which model the ringo permission system.

See `Adding Authorization tutorial
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/tutorials/wiki2/authorization.html>`_
for more information how things work in general under the hood.

See :mod:`ringo.lib.security` for documentation on helper functions used to build
the ACL.



Security measurements
=====================
Ringo has protection against common threads of webapplication included.

CSRF-Protection
---------------
To protect against CSRF attacks ringo follows the recommodation of `OWASP
<http://url>`_ and adds a synchroniser token to each form, which will be sent
and checked on each POST request. The token will be unique on every request.
GET requests in ringo are not protected as GET functions in ringo should be
idempotent and does not trigger expensive opertaions. Following this simple
philosophie on GET requests will make any further CSRF protection obsolete.

XSS-Protection
--------------
Ringo will add the following headers to protect the application against XSS attacks.

 * 'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
 * 'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff'

Further ringo provides an option to enable a contect CSP for further
protection. The CSP is disabled on default but can be enabled in the
application :ref:`conf_headers` configuration.

Clickjacking-Protection
-----------------------
Cookie and Session security
---------------------------

DOS-Protection
--------------
DOS protection is not handled by ringo. Protection against DOS-attacks should
be handled by the Reverse Proxy or Firewall.

***************
Basic DB Schema
***************
Below you see the basic schema of the ringo database. The schema only lists
some central tables which help to understand how the things are wired together
in ringo. The table colored orange `example` table in the top left is an
example for any other table which will store items of a modul.
Every item of an item has a reference to the module it belogs to. Further the
current example has a reference to a user and a usergroup which defines the
ownership [#]_ per item is is important for the authorisation.

.. image:: images/database.png
   :alt: Basic database model.

Let us begin with the `modules` table. This table will store information on
all available modules in the system. It basically stores the configuration per
modul.  As described in the :ref:`modules` section each modul has
(:ref:`crud`) which are stored in the `actions` table. The NM-table
`nm_actions_roles` define which `roles` are allowed to use the actions in the
module. See :ref:`permissionsystem` for more information on how the
:ref:`authorisation` is implemented in ringo.

The `users` table stores all the users in ringo. The users table only holds
minimal data which is required for authentification and authorisation.
Additional information like the name, email etc. is stored in the `profiles`
table. Every user has a profile.

Users can be organised in groups using the `nm_user_groups` table. All
usergroups are stored in the `usergroups` table. Roles can be assigned to
usergroups and users. This is done with the NM-table `nm_user_roles` and
`nm_usergroup_roles`.

The table `user_settings` and `password_reset_request` are helper tables to
save user settings like saved search queries or store the tokens to trigger
the password reset.

.. [#] The ownership feature can be added by using the :ref:`mixin_owned`
   mixin.

********************
States and Workflows
********************
.. automodule:: ringo.model.statemachine

.. index::
   double: Configuration; Application

#############
Configuration
#############
The application can be configured by setting values in the
``ini`` file. Ringo provides some helper methods to give directly access to
some of the configuration options.

***********
Application
***********
Helper methods giving access to the configuration options are available in the `appinfo` module.

.. automodule:: ringo.lib.helpers.appinfo
   :members: get_app_mode, get_app_title, get_app_logo, get_app_inheritance_path

.. index::
   single: Configuration; Title

Title
=====
The name of the application used at various places in the application
can be configured with the following varible.

* app.title = Application name 

The title is available using the :func:`get_app_title` function.

.. index::
   single: Configuration; Custom static files
   see: Branding; Configuration

Custom static directory
=======================
It is possible to define a directory to include custom static files which
should not be part of the application. This can be usefull for application
branding to place custom logo graphics etc. You can define the path to the
root of that custom static folder.

* app.customstatic = /path/to/your/folder

If not defined it will be ringo:static.

.. index::
   single: Configuration; Logo

Logo
====
The logo of the application used in the header of the page. You can define a
path to the logo relative to the given custom static directory which should be
displayed. If no logo is set then no logo is displayed at all.

If you need more customization on the logo, then you need to overwrite the
logo.mako template.

* app.logo = images/ringo-logo-64.png

The logo is available using the :func:`get_app_logo` function.

.. index::
   double: Configuration; Inheritance
.. _config_app_base:

Application Base
================
Optional. Usually a ringo based application is directly based on ringo.
So the default inheritance path of your application is foo->ringo (in
case your application package is called "foo").

* app.base = Default is not set

If your application is based on another ringo based application you can
configure the name of the application here. Setting this configuration
will modify the inheritance path of the application.

The inheritance_path is available using the :func:`get_app_inheritance_path`
function.

Example:
The current application package is named "foo". "foo" is based on "bar". And
"bar" is based on "ringo". The inheritance path is foo->bar->ringo.

This has consequences for the loading of form and table configurations.
When trying to load form or table configuration ringo will iterate over
the inheritance path and try to load the configuration from each
application within the inheritance path.

Application Locale
==================
The locale is used to format dates times in the application.  On default Ringo
determines the locale by looking into the request getting the browser language
setting. However you can enforce setting the locale of the application by
setting the following config variable in your config

* app.locale =

If added (In the mean of adding the variable at all) the locale will be
enforced. An empty value means use a "default" encoding which leads to dates
formatted in ISO8601. Otherwise the locale must match a known ISO-3166 locale
string.

Application Mode
================
The application can be configured to be in a special "mode". Where mode can be
a demo, development, education or any other flavour of your application.
Setting the mode will result in some visual indication which is is different
to the normal application mode.

* app.mode =

Short description of the mode. If this value is set a application will have
some visual indication.

* app.mode_desc =

A longer description of the mode.

* app.mode_color_primary = #F2DEDE
* app.mode_color_secondary = red

The color of the mode indicator header and the border around the application.
Defaults to #F2DEDE (light red) and red. Allowed values are any usable in CSS,
such as hexadecimal or RGB values, named colors, etc.

The mode is available using the :func:`get_app_mode` function.

.. index:: Testing mode

History ignores
===============
You can configure URL which will be ignored in history. This is often needed
in case you do AJAX requests to fetch data. As you do not want those URL be
part of the history you can configure to ignore those URLs.

* app.history.ignore = /foo,/bar,/baz

The ignore list is a comma separated list of fragments of an URL. The code
will check if the current URL starts with one of the defined ignores.

Cache
=====
You can configure to cache the loaded configurations for the form
configs. This is usefull in production mode for a significant speed up
when loading large forms with many rules and conditionals.

* app.cache.formconfig = true

The default is not to cache the configuration.

Testing mode
============
You can set the application in some test mode which is usefull to test the
application. To enable the testmode set the `app.mode` attribute to *testing*.

In this mode you can start Testcases which are embedded in its own transaction
on the database.
In a Testcase you can do a series of queries to the application and add, delete or
modify data. 
When you stop the Testcase the changes you have made in the Testcase will be
rolled back.

When enabled the webinterface has an additional link to start and end a
Testcase which will be handled in a transaction.

In unittests you can use the following URLs to start a Testcase:

* /_test_case/start
* /_test_case/stop

Feature Toggles
===============
Feature toggles can be used to enable specific code paths in the
application by setting a config variable in the ini file. This is
usefull to make features which are currently under development available

Feature toggles are set in the *ini* file like this:: 

    feature.mynewfeaure = true.

The configuration is available in the current request and can be used
everywhere in the application where the request is available.::

    if request.ringo.feature.mynewfeaure:
        # Feature is anabled
        pass
    else:
        # Feature is not anabled
        pass

Please note that the value in the configuration must be set to *true* to
consider the feature to be enabled. If the feature is set to anything
different or isn't configured at all it is considered to be not enabled.


******
Layout
******

Default Overview complexity
===========================

.. versionchanged:: 1.5
   Prior version 1.5 the default overview was always the more complex
   overview.

You can define which complexity the the overview pages in
ringo will have on default. There are two complexities available:

1. A simple Overview. This overview provides a simple
   search widget which may be enough for the most use cases.
2. A advanced more complex overview. This overview provides a stackable
   search, regular expressions, pagination and a feature to save a search.

* layout.advanced_overviews = Default is false, which means without
  further configuration the simple overviews are used.

The complexity can be configured per overview table using the
``table.json`` configuration which is available for all tables in the
system.

.. _admin_sessiontimer:

Session Timer
=============
You can configure to show a session timer widget in the header of the
application. The session timer will show the time left in the current session
and provides a button to refresh the session.

* layout.show_sessiontimer = true.
  
Default is false, no widget is shown.

The time of the session timer is configured in :ref:`admin_autologout`.

Login Info
==========
You can configure to show the last successful and last failed login on the
start page. This can help the user to identify possible misuse of their
account.

Additionally a warning is shown if there has been more than 5 failed login
attemps since the last successful login.

* layout.show_logininfo = true.

Default is false, no info is shown.

.. note::
        The login info is an inclued mako file in the index.mako template.
        Please do not forget to include the logininfo.mako template in your
        index page in case you have overwritten the index page.



Read and Update Pages
=====================

.. index::
   single: String Representation

Modulname in title
------------------
Usually the title of the entry is in the format "Name of the modul: String
representation of the modul".

You configure to omit the leading name of the modul to have more space and
options to show a more custom title your own title.

* layout.show_modulname = true

Default is true, so the name of the modul is shown is shown.

Contextmenu
-----------
You can configure if the context menu will be displayed in the detailed item
view. For simple applications this menu might provide too much functionallity
which tends to be confusing to other users. So you can completeley disable it.

.. image:: images/screenshots/ui/contextmenu.png

* layout.show_contextmenu = true

Default is true, so the menu is shown.

.. note::
   
   This setting only applies for users who does not have the admin role!
   Admins will always see the contextmenu available. Please not if your
   disable the menu the users will loose access to some default actions like
   changing the ownership. 


Sessions
========

Beaker is used for session handling. Please refer to its documentation to get
more information on the available configuraton options.

 * session.type = file
 * session.data_dir = %(here)s/data/sessions/data
 * session.lock_dir = %(here)s/data/sessions/lock
 * session.key = customerskey
 * session.timeout = 1800

The following options regard to the cookie identifying the session in the
client. The configuration option are taken from the global :ref:`conf_cookies`
security settings:

session.secret 
        Defaults to *security.cookie_secret*

session.secure
        Defaults to *security.cookie_secure*

session.cookie_expires
        Defaults to *security.cookie_expires*

session.httponly
        Defaults to *security.cookie_httponly*

session.path 
        Defaults to *security.cookie_path*

session.domain
        Defaults to *security.cookie_domain*

****************
Authentification
****************
Authentication is stored with in a auth_tkt cookie.  See `Cookie options on
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/authentication.html>`_
for more details. The settings as taken from the global :ref:`conf_cookies`
security settings.

.. _admin_autologout:

Autologout
==========
The authentication only stay valid for the given time. After that time a
automatic logout from the application will happen.


auth.timeout
        Defaults to 1800 seconds.

auth.timeout_warning
        Defaults to 30 seconds.

The timeout_warning variable defines how many seconds before the actual logout a
warning dialog will be raised.

If you want to display a nice sessiontimer than look also in :ref:`admin_sessiontimer`.

Passwort reminder and user registration
=======================================
Ringo provides methods to allow users to register a new account or send
requests to reset their passwords. Botch subsystems can be enabled by changing
the following values.

auth.register_user
        Defaults to `false`. Enable the option to let users register a new
        account. However the account must be *finished* by the administrator.

auth.register_user_default_roles
        Defaults to the default user role. Can be defined as a comma separated
        list of role ids.

auth.register_user_default_groups
        Defaults to the default user group. Can be defined as a comma separated
        list of group ids.

auth.password_reminder
        Defaults to `false`. Enable the option to let the user reset their
        password.

.. note::
    To enable this feature the mailsystem must be configured too. You
    need to set the mail host and the default sender in your config.

.. note::
    To enable this feature the mailsystem must be configured too. You
    need to set the mail host and the default sender in your config.

Authentification callback
=========================
You can configure a callback method which is called after the user is
basically authenticated. This callback can be used to cancel the
authentification proccess by doing further checks on the user, or
trigger some actions after the user logs in. The callback must have the
following form::

        from ringo.lib.security import AuthentificationException

        def auth_callback(request, user):
            # permit admin user to login.
            if user.login == "admin":
                raise AuthentificationException("Admin is not allowed")

To cancel the authentification the function must raise an exception. The message
of the exception is used as error message. In all other cases to user is
authenticated.

Can need to configure this callback in the *ini* file:

auth.callback = foo.bar.callback

*foo.bar.callback* must be the modul path which can be used to import the
function.

.. _anonymous_access:

"Anonymous" access
==================
But you can define a default user which is used as authenticated user:

auth.anonymous_user
        Defaults to None. So no user is authenticated.

.. warning::
    If enabled every user which enters the application will use the
    application as the configured user in the same way as the user really logs
    in.

You can define the user by givin the loginname of the user. Of course
the user must be present in the application.

********
Security
********

CSRF Protection
===============
To enable CSRF protection you can configure ringo to include a CSRF
synchronizer token to each form to protect POST request against CSRF attacks.

security.enable_csrf_check = true
        Defaults to `true`

However, for testing issues it might be useful to disable this feature.

.. _conf_cookies:

Cookies
=======
security.cookie_secret
        Defaults to a randomly generated 50 char long string. Value used to
        sign the cookie to prevent manipulation of the content of the cookie.
        If not set the value will be regenerated on every application start.

        .. tip::
           During development it is usefull to set the value to a static
           string to prevent invalidating the cookie on every application
           restart.

        .. important::
           In productive operation: Please ensure that this value is set to a randomly generated
           string. Either by not setting the value at all (and let the application generate a random string) or setting it to a static random generated string.

security.cookie_secure
        Default to `false`. If set to `true` the cookie is only accessible
        over a secure connection (SSL).

        .. important::
           In productive operation: Please ensure that this value is set to
           true if you use a SSL enabled connection.

security.cookie_ip
        Defaults to `true`. If set to `true` the cookie is bound to the IP
        address.

        .. caution::
           Although this settings **can** increase the security it may cause
           problems in if the IP address is not stable which is true for most
           dialup connections.

security.cookie_httponly
        Defaults to `true`. If set to `true` the cookie is not accessible
        directly by the client but can only be changed through a http
        connection.

security.cookie_expires
        Defaults to `true`. If set to `true` the cookie will expires after the
        browser is closed.

security.cookie_path
        Defaults to `/`. The scope of the cookie will bound to the given path
        in the application.

security.cookie_domain
        Defaults to the current domain and all subdomains (is automatically determined by the
        server). The scope of the cookie will bound to a specific domain.

security.cookie_name
        Defaults to 'auth_tkt'. Needs to be set in case you have multiple
        ringo applications on the same server.

.. _conf_headers:

Headers
=======
See `this page <http://ghaandeeonit.tumblr.com/post/65698553805/securing-your-pyramid-application>`_ for more informations.

 * security.header_secure = true
 * security.header_clickjacking = true
 * security.header_csp = false

You can define `CSP Options <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy>`_ by configuring one of the following
options:

 * security.csp.default_src
 * security.csp.script_src
 * security.csp.object_src
 * security.csp.style_src
 * security.csp.img_src
 * security.csp.media_src
 * security.csp.frame_src
 * security.csp.font_src
 * security.csp.connect_src
 * security.csp.sandbox
 * security.csp.frame_ancestors

Caching
=======
Number of seconds the cached content will stay valid. A value of non means no
caching at all and all elements are loaded on every request.

The enhance the security follwing the recommodation of measurement M 4.401 of
`BSI Grundschutz <https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/ITGrundschutz/ITGrundschutzKataloge/Inhalt/_content/m/m04/m04401.html;jsessionid=116E42B16FBC9D779FD768E7CDE905A1.2_cid368>`_ you should disable the caching.

 * security.page_http_cache = 0
 * security.static_http_cache = 3600

.. note::
   The caching setting of the page currently only applies to the CRUD
   operations of the modules and not to the static pages like contact, home
   etc.

.. warning::
   Caching of dynmic generated pages might result in some unexpected behaviour
   such as outdated items in overview lists. Therefor ther default disables
   caching here.

**********
DB Caching
**********
.. warning::
        This feature is experimantal. It might change or removed completely in
        the next versions of Ringo.

Ringo supports file based caching of DB queries using a dogpile cache. Caching
is disabled on default and must be enabled.

.. note::
        Ringo does not try to use the cache on default. You will need to
        write code to tell Ringo to do so explicit! Unless you do not have any
        code that tries to use the cache you will not need to enable it here
        at all.

To enable the cache you need to define where to save the cache:

 * db.cachedir = path/to/the/cachebasedir

The queries are cached in so called `regions` which will stay valid for a
given time before the cache is invalidated. The regions can be configured in
the following way:

 * db.cacheregions = default:3600 short:50 ...

The multiple regions are separated with spaces. A singe regions consists of the
name and the time the regions should be valid. Name and time is colomn
separated.


****
Mail
****
The configuration of the Mail system is described in detail in the
`documentation of the pyramid_mailer library
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_mailer/en/latest/#configuration>`_

Below you find a show overview of the most common used settings. If you need
more of the settings it is save to add them to your configuration.


 * mail.host =

This is the host where your MTA will listen on port 25 to receive the mails
which it will transfer to the recipients.

 * mail.default_sender =

This is the default sender email (From:) of the mails sent from this
application. Often this will be changed within the application anyway but we
need to be sure we have a default sender. Often this is a "noreply@foo.bar"
address.

 * mail.username =
 * mail.password =

In case your MTA requires some sort of authentication you can set it here.

*********
Converter
*********
The converter has become part of the `ringo printtemplates
extension <https://github.com/ringo-framework/ringo_printtemplates>`_. It is
used to convert ODS files into PDF files.

Please see the README of the library for more details on how to configure the
converter.

CLI ringo-admin
###############
Use the following command to get general help on the available commands::

        ringo-admin help

.. important::
        All of the following commands will take the `development.ini`
        configuration file as their defautl configfile to retrieve
        informations like the db connection. Please make sure you set the
        correct config file before invoking the command to prevent operations
        on the wrong database!

.. _clidb:

**************
ringo-admin db
**************
Use the following command to get general help on the available commands::

        ringo-admin db help

Init database
=============
The database can be initiated with the following command::

        ringo-admin db init

Generate migration
==================
A new migration file can be generated with the following command::

        ringo-admin db revision

Upgrade database
================
The database can be upgraded by applying the migration scripts::

        ringo-admin db upgrade

Downgrade database
==================
The database can be downgraded by removing the last migration scripts::

        ringo-admin db downgrade 

Export data
===========
The data of a specfic module can be exported in a fixture by invoking the
following command::


        ringo-admin db savedata <modulname> > fixture.json

Importing data
==============
The data of a specfic module can be imported in a fixture by invoking the
following command::

        ringo-admin db loaddata --loadbyid <modulname> <fixture>

This will load the data in the fixture and insert or update the items in the
database. Deleting items is not supported.

The option *--loadbyid* changes the mode how exiting items in the database are
loaded for either update or, in case there is no record found, creating a new
item. The default is loading mechanism is loading by  the items UUID. But this
isn't practical for loading initial data.

Fixing Sequences
================
After loading data into the database it is often needed to fix the sequences
in the database to make the incremental counters work correct::

        ringo-admin db fixsequence

****************
ringo-admin user
****************
Use the following command to get general help on the available commands::

        ringo-admin user help

Set password
============
The password of a given user can be changed/set by invoking the following
command::

        ringo-admin user <login> --password <password>

The `password` parameter is optional. If not given ringo will autoegenerate a
new password for you.

********************
ringo-admin fixtures
********************
Initial data can inserted in the application by loading fixtures. Fixtures are
basically the export of the item of a model in JSON format. Actually the whole
loading and saving data is implemented by using the importer and exporter.

.. note::
   Please note that you must take care to load the fixtures in correct order,
   because to keep the integrity of the database.

The folder for the fixtures should be named *fixtures* and located in the
application folder.

The default location of the fixtures is the fixtures directory of your
application.  You can define an alternative path the the fixtures when
invoking the load or save command by providing the `--path` option.

There are some naming conventions. Fixtures should be namen
'NN_modulname.json'. NN means is used to order the fixtures and determines in
which order the fixtures will be loaded. The modulname configures for which
module the fixtures contains data. The name of the module name is identical
with the name of the database table which has a appended "s". E.g the *user*
modul becomes to *users*. This is even true if the appended "s" is written
wrong.

Use the following command to get general help on the available commands::

        ringo-admin fixtures help

Load data
=========
By invoking the following command::

        ringo-admin fixtures load

all fixtures in the fixtures directory will be loaded and inserted in the
database.

Using the `--path` allows to define a alternative path to the fixture files.

Save data
=========
By invoking the following command::

        ringo-admin fixtures save

all fixtures in the fixtures directory will be loaded and the data for each
modul will be written into the fixture.

Using the `--path` allows to define a alternative path to the fixture files.


.. _climod:

*****************
ringo-admin modul
*****************
Use the following command to get general help on the available commands::

        ringo-admin modules help

Add new modul
=============
By invoking the following command::

        ringo-admin modul add <modulname in singular form> 

A new modul will be added to your application. See :ref:`modules` for more
details.

Generate model fields from form config

By invoking the following command::

        ringo-admin modul fields <name of the modul>

The python code with the SQLAlchemy model will be generated. The code can be
pasted into the model.

Application Deployment

.. _deployment_subpath:

****************************************************
Running the application in a different path than "/"
****************************************************
If the application is hosted in a subpath, than need to make sure that the
`SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO` variable are set correct, as both variables are
crucial for a pyramid application to handle the requests and build urls using
the `request.route_*` functions correct. 

Ideally those variables are set before the request enters your application.
This means you do this directly in the serving component. The configuration of
the server components are out of scope of this documentation. Please refer to
the documentation of your server component!

But instead of transforming the variables directly in the server you can also
configure your application to do so. This way you get indepentend from the
server, with the drawback that the information about the path need also be set
in your application configuration. Here comes the following options.

.. rubric:: Use a "prefix" middleware

All requests are routed through another middleware which will modify the
`SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO`. Here is how to configure it::

        [filter:paste_prefix]
        use = egg:PasteDeploy#prefix
        prefix = /myapp

        [pipeline:main]
        pipeline =
           paste_prefix
           myapp

        [app:myapp]
        ...

.. rubric:: Build a "composite" application

Originally intended to map differen URLs to different
applications/services (SAS) this can be also used to get the SCRIPT_NAME and
PATH_INFO right. See `Paste documentation for urlmap
<http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/index.html?highlight=urlmap>`_ for more
informations. Here is a short example to get the idea::

        [composite:main]
        use = egg:Paste#urlmap
        # This is the mapping of the path /myapp to an application named
        # myapp 
        /myapp = myapp
        ...

        [app:myapp]
        ...

uWSGI & Nginx
=============
Make sure your have installed the follwing additional packages in your virtualenv:

 * uWSGI
 * PasteDeploy (needed to be able to read the application configuration from
   the ini file)
 * PasteScript (needed to get the logging configured based on the setting in
   the ini file)

Add the following into your ini file::

        [uwsgi]
        master = true
        socket = /tmp/uwsgi.sock
        virtualenv = /path/to/virtualenv

        # PERMISSIONS
        # Make sure that ngnix has permission to read and write to the socket.
        # You can use one or more of the following options:
        #chmod-socket =
        #uid =
        #gid =

        # DAEMONIZE
        # Send it in the background. If daemonize is set it wil log its output
        # into given logfile
        #daemonize = ./uwsgi.log
        #pidfile = ./uwsgi.pid

        # LOGGING
        # paste-logger =
        # Yes, there is no argument for the paste-logger.

Some notes on logging:

1. The Logfile must be writeable for the uWSGI process!

2. Make sure that your logging configuration of the application does not
   contain any place holders like "%(here)s". They are not valid in the scope
   of uWSGI.

3. On default the log of the uwsgi process will contain the requests as same
   as the logging from the application. If you want to separate this I advice
   you to disable to console logging in your pyramid application. Instead use
   a FileLogger which will log the logging in the application to a different
   location. See `Pyramid logging documentation for more details
   <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid//en/latest/narr/logging.html>`_

Add the following into your ngnix configuration::

        location / {
            uwsgi_pass  unix:///tmp/uwsgi.sock;
            include     uwsgi_params;
        }

Start the uwsgi server by invoking the following command::

        uwsgi --ini-paste--logged development.ini

For debugging purpose I recommend to disable daemonizing in the uWSGI
configuration.


Nginx as Reverse Proxy
======================
Add the following into your ngnix configuration::

        location / {
            proxy_set_header        Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:7450;

        }
